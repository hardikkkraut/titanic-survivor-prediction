## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hardikkkraut/titanic-survivor-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survivor-prediction
   ```
2.  Install the necessary Python packages.  A `requirements.txt` file might be needed, but is not in the repo currently, so this step is generic.
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn notebook  # Example - adjust as needed based on notebook contents
   ```

## Usage

1.  Open and run the `titanic_survival.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis and modeling.
2.  The `app.py` file, if present, can be used to deploy the model.
3.  Review `submission.csv` for the predicted results on the test dataset.
